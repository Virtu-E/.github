## Democratizing Quality Education in Malawi

---

## The Problem
### 40 million students in Sub-Saharan Africa receive substandard education that prevents academic progression

**In Malawi alone:**
- 2.9% population growth rate creates 200,000+ new students annually
- Teacher-to-student ratios exceed 1:100 in many schools
- 80% of students cannot compete with well-resourced private schools
- Students abandon education because poor content quality makes progression impossible

**The core issue isn't economicâ€”it's educational inequality:**
- Lack of proper curriculum-aligned content
- No internet access to quality learning materials  
- Fragmented resources that students can't consolidate
- Underdeveloped education industry stuck in analog methods
